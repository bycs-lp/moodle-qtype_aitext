A Moodle question type that accepts free-text answers and grades them with a remote Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT or a self-hosted Ollama model. Each question defines its own grading prompt and optional marking scheme, so the AI evaluates responses against criteria you set.

## Requirements

- Moodle 4.5 or later.
- Access to the API of an external LLM.

## How it works

You supply two things per question:

1. A **prompt** telling the AI how to evaluate the response.
2. An optional **marking scheme** describing how to award marks.

For the question *"Write an English sentence in the past tense"*, the prompt could be:

> Explain if there is anything wrong with the grammar in this text.

And a marking scheme could be:

> Give 10 marks if there are no errors, all spelling is correct and it is in the past tense. Give 0 marks if the grammar is incorrect. Deduct one mark for every word that is misspelled.

A **prompt tester** field in the question editing form uses AJAX to try prompts out directly, without stepping through the question preview screen.

## Grading

Grading runs through two dedicated companion question behaviours rather than overriding Moodle's core behaviours:

- [`qbehaviour_immediate_for_aitext`](https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle-qbehaviour_immediate_for_aitext)
- [`qbehaviour_deferred_for_aitext`](https://github.com/marcusgreen/moodle-qbehaviour_deferred_for_aitext)

These are separate plugins and must be installed alongside this question type, under `question/behaviour/immediate_for_aitext` and `question/behaviour/deferred_for_aitext`. Without them, AIText questions cannot be graded.

This keeps AIText grading predictable and isolated from other question types. Existing quiz attempts that used the legacy `interactivecountback` behaviour are migrated automatically on upgrade; attempts belonging to other question types are left untouched.

If the configured AI tools are unavailable, grading degrades gracefully instead of erroring, so an attempt is not lost.

### Manual grading

AI-generated feedback can be shown to a human grader and used as a reference when marking a response manually.
